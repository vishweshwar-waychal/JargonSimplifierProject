## üß† Prompt Engineering

This app uses a dynamically generated prompt based on user input and selected audience. Here's how the prompt is formed internally:

```js
const prompt = `Simplify the following technical text for a ${audience}:\n\n"${inputText}"\n\nAvoid jargon and make it easy to understand. Only respond in plain English.`;
```
- ${audience} is selected from a dropdown (e.g., 10-year-old, general audience, non-technical friend)
- ${inputText} is what the user types into the textbox
- The prompt ensures the model avoids jargon and explains clearly in plain English
